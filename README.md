## ðŸ“– Abstract

Context:
The software industry is adopting the DevOps paradigm to an increasingly frequent extent, and researchersâ€™ interest in it is also growing to formalize its core concepts. In addition, the trend of developing software in a distributed manner greatly increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced team members from software companies to work remotely.

Objective:
This paper aims to analyse how DevOps has been adopted in distributed settings in order to determine how these two software engineering trends have interacted, reporting either positive or negative effects.

Method:
We present the results of a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) of how DevOps has been applied in distributed and global settings that adopts Global Software Development (GSD). The results were obtained from analysing 27 papers.

Results:
The results obtained after carrying our SMS are summarized in (1) a proposed definition of DevOps in distributed and global settings, (2) the practices used to implement DevOps in distributed and global settings, (3) the goals for adopting it in such settings, (4) the benefits obtained, (5) the challenges faced and (6) the tools used for implementing the identified practices. In addition, we (7) mapped the challenges detected with a list of well-known GSD risks and (8) mapped the benefits that can be obtained from applying certain practices identified and the challenges that should be overcame to obtain such benefits.

Conclusion:
There is still a need to standardize a definition of DevOps in global settings. Moreover, we suggest defining a framework for adopting DevOps in such settings that allow to obtain the benefits identified meanwhile minimising the challenges faced. With that aim, the results obtained from (7) and (8) can be used as starting point.
